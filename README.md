# Quick Practice for Refreshig Languages

A minimalist command line representation of the most basic version of Conway's Game of Life.

## Next Steps:

It would be cool to try and implement the FFT/convolution approach to the
problem. (Perhaps adapt the tkinter version, which as is, is way too slow.)

Adapting the c++ version to uses ncurses for dynamic sizing would be cool.

It would be nice to have a click to flip state option in one of the above too.
